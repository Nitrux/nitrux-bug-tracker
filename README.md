# Bug and Feature Request Tracker for Nitrux

Nitrux uses GitHub to keep track of bugs and their fixes.

# Submitting a Bug Report

Before submitting a bug, you should look at the [existing bug reports](https://github.com/Nitrux/nitrux-bug-tracker/issues) and [known issues](https://nxos.org/known-issues) to verify nobody else has reported it or it's not already fixed.

1. Go to the Issues tab.
2. Click the New Issue button.
3. Click on **🐞 Bug report.**
4. Complete all the relevant information requested by the template.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Open Issues without activity after 3 days will be considered stale. And issues without activity after 7 days will be automatically closed.

## What qualifies as a bug report?

Please do not file a bug report to:

- **Request new software**.
  - For such circumstances, please submit a [feature request](#how-to-make-a-feature-request).
- **Report bugs in upstream software** (unless the issue is unique to Nitrux).
  - Example: If GIMP crashes on Arch, Fedora, and Nitrux, do not report it here. That is an upstream bug.
  - Exception: If GIMP works elsewhere but crashes only on Nitrux, please report it here.
  - Note: Always report issues with Maui Apps or Nitrux-specific configurations here.
- **Discuss policies or propose general ideas**.
    - For such circumstances, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Nitrux/discussions).

> [!NOTE]
> We use labels to communicate the state of a report. We reserve the discretion to apply these labels to any report based on its content to any issue—including marking incomplete reports or unsupported use cases (like virtualization).

Nitrux uses GitHub to keep track of feature requests and their implementation.

# Submitting a Feature Request

Before submitting a feature request, you should look at the [existing feature requests](https://github.com/Nitrux/nitrux-bug-tracker/issues) and [release announcements](https://nxos.org/changelog) to verify that nobody else has requested it or that it isn't already present.

1. Go to the Issues tab.
2. Click the New Issue button.
3. Click on **🚀 Feature request**
4. Complete all the relevant information requested by the template.

## How do I write a reasonable feature request?

- **Be specific**. Define exactly what you want and why.
- **Visualize it**. Include images or mockups that make the request clear.
- **Back it up**. Reference factual content or use cases to support your request.

## What should I not do?

- **Don't be vague** about the benefits or possible drawbacks.
- **Don't rely on the community to figure it out**. While this is your request, you must clearly outline the implementation or goal. Unclear requests may be closed.
- **Avoid emotional arguments**. Stick to technical or practical reasons.
- **Be realistic**. Keep the scope of the request achievable.
- **Do not file requests for upstream software**.
    - For example: Nitrux cannot add "tilt-shift effects" to GIMP; that is a request for GIMP developers.
    - However, Nitrux can add missing drivers, firmware, CLI utilities, or consider adding a new GUI application to the default selection.
- **Do not use the this repository for general ideas or policy debates**.
    - For such circumstances, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Nitrux/discussions).
