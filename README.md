# Bug and Feature Request Tracker for Nitrux
## How to report a Bug
Nitrux uses GitHub to keep track of bugs and their fixes.

#### Determine if the bug is a bug

You should not file a bug report if you want to:

1. Request new software.
    - For such circumstances, please add a [feature request](#how-to-make-a-feature-request).
3. Filing a bug against software not maintained or developed by Nitrux, unless it's specific to Nitrux.
    - For example, only open a bug report if GIMP crashes only in Nitrux. If it's a general crash due to a bug in GIMP, don't open a bug report here.
    - Also, please open a bug report in this repository if the Maui Apps have issues, or if a setting we apply is causing an adverse effect.
5. Discuss features or existing policies, or propose new features or ideas.
    - For such circumstances, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Nitrux/discussions).

#### Submitting a bug report

Before submitting a bug, you should look at the [existing bug reports]([url](https://github.com/Nitrux/nitrux-bug-tracker/issues)) and [known issues]([url](https://nxos.org/known-issues)) to verify nobody else has reported it.

You must specify three things:

1. What do you expect to happen?
2. What happened?
3. If possible, a minimal series of steps is necessary to make it happen, where level 1 is "start the program."

#### Additional information about the bug

Some extra options you can use to make your bug report more complete:

1. This bug is a security vulnerability: Please check this only if your bug report describes behavior that a malicious actor could exploit to compromise your security or safety and cause issues such as identity theft or "hi-jacking."
2. Include an attachment: Add supporting attachments to explain or help others reproduce the bug. An attachment might include a screenshot, a video capture of the problem, or a sample document that triggers the fault.

## How to make a Feature Request
Nitrux uses GitHub to keep track of feature requests.

#### Submitting a feature request

Before submitting a feature request, you should look at the [existing feature requests](https://github.com/Nitrux/nitrux-bug-tracker/issues) and [release announcements](https://nxos.org/changelog) to verify that nobody else has requested it.

#### How do I write a reasonable feature request?

1. A feature request should be specific.
2. Include images that would make the request tangible.
3. Reference factual content in support of your request.

#### What should I not do?

1. Avoid being vague about the benefits (or possible drawbacks).
2. Don't leave the specifics up to the community. While this is your feature request, it should clearly outline what you think. Unclear requests may be closed as too broad or unclear.
3. Avoid emotional discussions or motivations.
4. Don't ask for the moon; be realistic.
5. Avoid filing a feature request against software not maintained or developed by Nitrux.
    - For example, Nitrux can't add a new feature to GIMP like tilt-shift effects
    - On the contrary, Nitrux can add a missing driver or firmware file, CLI utility, or (put into consideration) another GUI application to the default selection.
