# Bug Repository for Nitrux
## How to report bugs
Nitrux uses GitHub to keep track of bugs and their fixes.

## Determine if the bug is a bug
You should not file a bug if you are:

1. Requesting new software.
2. _Discussing features, existing policy, proposing features, or ideas._ For such circumstances, please send us an email.
3. Filing a bug against software not provided by Nitrux.

## Submitting a Bug

Before submitting a bug, you should look at the [existing bug reports](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3ANitrux+) and [release notes](https://sourceforge.net/p/nitruxos/news/) to verify the bug hasn't been reported already. If the bug has not previously been reported, you should file a new bug report.

You must specify three things:

1. What you expected to happened
2. What happened
3. If possible, a minimal series of steps necessary to make it happen, where level 1 is "start the program."

## Notes

Some extra options you can use to make your bug report more complete:

1. This bug is a security vulnerability: Please check this only if your bug report describes behavior that could be exploited to compromise your security or safety, as well as cause issues such as identity theft or "hi-jacking."

2. Include an attachment: add supporting attachments to explain or help others reproduce the bug. This might consist of a screenshot, a video capture of the problem, or a sample document that triggers the fault.
