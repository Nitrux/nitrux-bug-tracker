# Bug and Feature Request Tracker for Nitrux

Nitrux uses GitHub to keep track of bugs and their fixes.

# Submitting a Bug Report

Before submitting a bug, you should look at the [existing bug reports](https://github.com/Nitrux/nitrux-bug-tracker/issues) and [known issues](https://nxos.org/known-issues) to verify nobody else has reported it or it's not already fixed.

1. Go to the Issues tab.
2. Click the New Issue button.
3. Click on **🐞 Bug report.**
4. Complete all the relevant information requested by the template.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Open Issues without activity after 3 days will be considered stale. And issues without activity after 7 days will be automatically closed.

> [!NOTE]
> We use labels to communicate the state of a report. Maintainers will apply the appropriate labels to any issue—including marking incomplete reports or unsupported use cases (like virtualization) as .

## Determine if the bug is a bug

You should not file a bug report if you want to:

1. Request new software.
    - For such circumstances, please add a [feature request](#how-to-make-a-feature-request).
2. Filing a bug against software not maintained or developed by Nitrux, unless it's specific to Nitrux.
    - For example, only open a bug report if GIMP crashes only in Nitrux. If it's a general crash due to a bug in GIMP, don't open a bug report here.
    - On the other hand, please open a bug report in this repository if the Maui Apps have issues, or if a setting we apply is causing an adverse effect.
3. Discuss features or existing policies, or propose new features or ideas.
    - For such circumstances, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Nitrux/discussions).

# Submitting a Feature Request

Before submitting a feature request, you should look at the [existing feature requests](https://github.com/Nitrux/nitrux-bug-tracker/issues) and [release announcements](https://nxos.org/changelog) to verify that nobody else has requested it or that it isn't already present.

1. Go to the Issues tab.
2. Click the New Issue button.
3. Click on **🚀 Feature request**
4. Complete all the relevant information requested by the template.

## How do I write a reasonable feature request?

- A feature request should be specific.
- Include images that would make the request tangible.
- Reference factual content in support of your request.

## What should I not do?

- Avoid being vague about the benefits (or possible drawbacks).
- Don't leave the specifics up to the community. While this is your feature request, it should clearly outline what you think. Unclear requests may be closed as too broad or unclear.
- Avoid emotional discussions or motivations.
- Don't ask for the moon; be realistic.
- Avoid filing a feature request against software not maintained or developed by Nitrux.
    - For example, Nitrux can't add a new feature to GIMP like tilt-shift effects
    - On the contrary, Nitrux can add a missing driver or firmware file, CLI utility, or (put into consideration) another GUI application to the default selection.
