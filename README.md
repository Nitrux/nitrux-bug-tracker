# Bug and Feature Request Tracker for Nitrux
## How to report a Bug
Nitrux uses GitHub to keep track of bugs and their fixes.

#### Determine if the bug is a bug
You should not file a bug if you are:

1. Requesting new software.
2. _Discussing features, existing policy, proposing features, or ideas._ For such circumstances, please add a feature request.
3. Filing a bug against software not provided by Nitrux.

#### Submitting a bug report

Before submitting a bug, you should look at the [existing bug reports](https://github.com/Nitrux/nitrux-bug-tracker/issues) and [known issues](https://nxos.org/known-issues) to verify the bug hasn't been reported already. If the bug has not been reported, you should file a new bug report.

You must specify three things:

1. What you expect to happen.
2. What happened.
3. If possible, a minimal series of steps are necessary to make it happen, where level 1 is "start the program."

#### Notes on bug

Some extra options you can use to make your bug report more complete:

1. This bug is a security vulnerability: Please check this only if your bug report describes behavior that a malicious actor could exploit to compromise your security or safety, as well as cause issues such as identity theft or "hi-jacking."

2. Include an attachment: add supporting attachments to explain or help others reproduce the bug. An attachment might consist of a screenshot, a video capture of the problem, or a sample document that triggers the fault.

## How to make a Feature Request
Nitrux uses GitHub to keep track of feature requests.

#### Submitting a bug report

Before submitting a feature request, you should look at the [existing bug reports](https://github.com/Nitrux/nitrux-bug-tracker/issues) and [release announcements](https://nxos.org/changelog) to verify the feature hasn't been requested already. If the feature has not been request, you should file a new feature request.

#### How do I write a good feature request?

1. A feature request should be specific.
2. Include images that would make the request tangible.
3. Reference factual content in support of your request.

#### What should I not do?

1. Avoid being vague about the benefits (or possible drawbacks).
2. Don't leave the specifics up to the community. While this is your feature request, it should clearly outline the scope. Unclear requests may be subject to closure as being too broad or... unclear.
3. Avoid emotional discussions or motivations.
4. Don't ask for the moon; be realistic.
5. Filing a feature request against software not provided by Nitrux.
