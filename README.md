# Bug Repository for Nitrux 1.1.x Releases
## How to report bugs
Nitrux uses GitHub to keep track of bugs and their fixes.

## Determine if the bug is really a bug
You should not file a bug if you are:

1. Requesting new software.
2. _Discussing features, existing policy, proposing features, or ideas. If you are a Patreon Supporter please head over [here](https://github.com/Nitrux/patreon-feature-requests) instead._
3. Filing a bug against software not provided by Nitrux.

## Submitting a Bug

Before submitting a bug, you should look at the [existing bug reports](https://github.com/Nitrux/nitrux-iso-bug-tracker/issues) and [release notes](https://sourceforge.net/p/nitruxos/news/) to verify the bug hasnâ€™t been reported already. If the bug has not already been reported, you should file a new bug report.

It's important that you specify three things:

1. What you expected to happened
2. What actually happened
3. If possible, a minimal series of steps necessary to make it happen, where step 1 is "start the program"

## Notes

Some extra options you can use to make your bug report more complete:

1. This bug is a security vulnerability: Please check this only if your bug report describes a behaviour that could be exploited to compromise your security or safety, as well as cause issues such as identity theft or "hi-jacking".

2. Include an attachment: add supporting attachments to explain or help others reproduce the bug. This might include a screenshot, a video capture of the problem or a sample document that triggers the fault.
